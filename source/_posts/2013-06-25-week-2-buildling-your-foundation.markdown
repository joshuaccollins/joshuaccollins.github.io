### Week two of the three-week crash course about computer programming leveraging existing teaching tools.


#### Serendipity

It was quite serendipitous that our guest speaker today at the [Flatiron School](http://www.flatironschool.com) was no other than the legendary [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/), creator of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). The timing was quite special because this week's focus is on JavaScript and jQuery. Pretty bloody awesome, right?! 

This week we are breaking free from the basics of HTML and CSS and starting to learn more about how to make our sites more asthetically appealing and entertaining by integrating dynamic functions. So what's JavaScript and jQuery? 

Well, thanks to the amazing team at [Skillcrush](http://www.skillcrush.com/terms/javascript.html), we have an artful explaination. Here is what they say about JavaScript and jQuery. Be sure to check out more of their [tech terms](http://skillcrush.com/terms/) if you are interested. They rock!

###### JavaScript:

JavaScript is a programming language that helps make a web page interactive.
When you view a slideshow or get annoying popup ads - that's JavaScript. If you see your Facebook Timeline update or Google autocomplete a search term - that's JavaScript.
When most anything changes on a page without you clicking a link - that's JavaScript!
JavaScript is one of the few programming languages that can work in your browser. Because of its ubiquity and how easy it was to learn, for many years it was dismissed by professionals as being a toy for amateurs.
This all changed around ten years ago with the advent of "AJAX" and "Web 2.0." These were sets of technology that used JavaScript in a whole new way, allowing the Web to be way more interactive than it had been before. So next time you use a Google Spreadsheet or watch a Tweet update on a web page, you can know what's going on - that's JavaScript!

###### jQuery:

jQuery is a library of preset JavaScript tasks that makes it easy and fast to make your site interactive and fun.
