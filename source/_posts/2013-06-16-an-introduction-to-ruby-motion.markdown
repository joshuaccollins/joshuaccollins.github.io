This weekend we had yet another plethora of assignments to complete for our [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com) [Captain](https://twitter.com/aviflombaum). One of the assignments was to dive into [Speaker Deck](http://www.speakerdeck.com) and find something of interest and report back to the class. 

We're about to start our third week and I feel like I've been thrown into the rushing rapids of a river that will eventually spit me out in the "deep end" of the learning pool. For some reason, even though I'm still grasping for air and am having difficulties with the current basics of Ruby, I decided to explore [RubyMotion](www.RubyMotion.com). I was sick of the basics, or should I say the frustration with feeling like I was walking with concrete shoes and wanted to explore something new. 

Thanks to [Tim Riley's](http://openmonkey.com/) presentation [Introduction to RubyMotion](http://openmonkey.com/) on Speaker Deck, I was able to start scratching the service on how Ruby could be used to developed iOS apps for iPhone, iPad, and OSX for MAC. 

This blog post will focus on the big take-aways I got from Tim's presentation with a little additional research on the [RubyMotion](www.RubyMotion.com) site. Before diving into the overview, please know I am new to the development world and have no experience developing for mobile devices.


### RubyMotion Takeaways:
 
##### Terminal
That's right, you get to use your terminal to build your iOS app. Some [people](http://devcodehack.com/xcode-sucks-and-heres-why/) are pretty [unhappy](http://code-ninja.org/blog/2012/03/14/ios-pain-points-autocomplete-in-xcode-is-a-usability-disaster/) with the Xcode process and development environment. Developers wanted to simply use their Terminal to develop and test their mobile products and that's what RubyMotion gave them.


##### Editor
Once again, users were very unhappy with the editor in Xcode so RubyMotion allows users to continue using their own Text Editors. Since I'm a newbie and haven't experienced the difficulties with Xcode, I'll trust the Tim's notes and the fact that RubyMotion has it as one of the six selling points on their website it must be important.

##### Interactive
There is an interactive console that lets you navigate and explore the process in your code and on a iPhone simulator. This function is pretty cool because it somewhat acts as an "inspect element" tool on websites bringing you to the exact spot on the code with a single click so you can make changes and edits.


##### 3rd Party Provider
Learning more and more about the development community, the one thing I have been so surprised with is all the "open-source" tools there are, for FREE. Crazy. Well, in this case, RubyMotion is not open-sourced and comes with a [$200](http://sites.fastspring.com/hipbyte/product/rubymotion) price tag.


##### Still need to know Objective-C
Yes, bummer. I was hoping for a turn-key solution that would magically transport my code into a beautiful iOS app. In this case, RubyMotion does do a lot of the heavy lifting, but you will need to learn how to interpret Apple's interfaces and understand how to call your code from Ruby. RubyMotion does provide helpful documentation.

##### GEMS != workâ€¦what?!?!?!
Yes, I couldn't believe it too. Last week we started exploring the [Ruby Gem Library](http://rubygems.org/) and learning about the power behind Ruby, so I was very very surprised to learn RubyMotion did not support it. I don't know implications this will have on my future work, but hopefully there is a solid solution. Here is what RubyMotion said about the Gem Issue: "Because RubyMotion implements a dialect of Ruby that is statically compiled, regular Ruby gems will not work in RubyMotion." They do have their "own flavor of gems" that they call [RubyMotion wrappers](http://rubymotion-wrappers.com/). 

##### Buy it! 
If you want to build for iOS and don't want to have to learn Objective-C from scratch, then it's the best option you have for mobile development.

A big thank you again to [Tim Riley](http://openmonkey.com/) for his [presentation](http://openmonkey.com/) on Speaker Deck. For more advanced developers, and those with experience with RubyMotion, please do excuse my novice review of this tool. If you have any further suggestions please feel free to share them with me.
